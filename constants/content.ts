**Understanding Your Heart**
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout your body. It beats approximately 100,000 times per day, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell.

**Key Risk Factors**
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Smoking
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Family history
- Stress

**Prevention Strategies**

**1. Maintain a Heart-Healthy Diet**
- Reduce saturated fats and sodium
- Include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Choose lean proteins
- Limit processed foods

**2. Regular Physical Activity**
At least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily strengthens the heart muscle and improves circulation.

**3. Manage Stress**
Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.

**4. Regular Health Check-ups**
Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar regularly.

**5. Quit Smoking and Limit Alcohol**
These lifestyle changes significantly reduce cardiovascular risk.

**Warning Signs**
Seek immediate medical attention for:
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Unusual fatigue
- Irregular heartbeat
- Swelling in legs or feet

Remember, prevention is always better than cure when it comes to heart health.`,
